Please test all your programs carefully and include all the test cases
with your program. You must have at least 3 `check-expect` tests for
each function.

### Problem 1, 5 points

Finish the function `first-letter-A-or-a?` in the [in-class
example](../examples/expressions_functions_solution.rkt) so that it
returns `#false` for an empty string, and all the other tests are still
passing.

### Problem 2

Read the step-by-step design process in [section
3.1](https://htdp.org/2019-02-24/part_one.html#%28part._sec~3adesign-func%29).
Note that we write our examples as check-expects rather than in
comments. Also note that we have skipped writing a stub for simple
fucntions (you would want to do it for more complex ones when you are
less certain about what may go into the expression in the function).

Exercises [36 (5
points)](https://htdp.org/2019-02-24/part_one.html#%28counter._%28exercise._design3%29%29),
[37 (5
points)](https://htdp.org/2019-02-24/part_one.html#%28counter._%28exercise._design4%29%29),
[38 (5
points)](https://htdp.org/2019-02-24/part_one.html#%28counter._%28exercise._design5%29%29).
Make sure to follow all steps of the design recipe, phrase your
\"expected cases\" as `check-expect` tests. Don\'t worry about an empty
string for exercises 37 and 38 (but make sure that your signature is
clear about expected data).

#### How to submit

Make sure that your file is named correctly:\
Name your file with the combination of your last names, no spaces,
followed by \"PS\" (for \"Problem set\" and the problem set number. For
instance, if your last names are Smith and Lee, the file name should be
`SmithLeePS2.rkt` If there are others in the class with the same name as
yours, you your initial in addition to your last name:
`MSmithJLeePS2.rkt`

At least one person in the group must submit it via canvas as a file
upload (make sure it\'s that `.rkt` file). Make a comment indicating who
you worked with. The other person (or people) in the group must either
submit the same file and also indicate who was in the group, or just
make a comment listing all your group members (note: if you don\'t
submit a note listing your group members, your work may not be counted,
even if your group partners list you as the group member).
