This is a simple set of exercises to give everyone some practice with the
basics of Racket and the DrRacket development environment.

Please test all your programs carefully and include all the test cases
with your program. You must have a `check-expect` test for each
expression and at least 3 `check-expect` tests for each function.

See the Canvas site for examples of solving similar exercises.

# Exercises

Do these three exercises from
[Chapter 1](https://htdp.org/2018-01-06/Book/part_one.html)
of the course text:

   * [Exercise 3 (3
pts)](https://htdp.org/2018-01-06/Book/part_one.html#%28counter._%28exercise._arith-s1%29%29)
   * [Exercise 4 (3
pts)](https://htdp.org/2018-01-06/Book/part_one.html#%28counter._%28exercise._arith-s2%29%29)
   * [Exercise 8 (5
pts)](https://htdp.org/2018-01-06/Book/part_one.html#%28counter._%28exercise._arith-b2%29%29)
      * In exercise 8 it\'s fine to implement just `tall` and `wide`, and not `square`.

#### How to submit

Make sure that your file is named correctly:\
Name your file with the combination of your last names, no spaces,
followed by \"PS\" (for \"Problem set\" and the problem set number. For
instance, if your last names are Smith and Lee, the file name should be
`SmithLeePS1.rkt` If there are others in the class with the same name as
yours, you your initial in addition to your last name:
`MSmithJLeePS1.rkt`

At least one person in the group must submit it via canvas as a file
upload (make sure it\'s that `.rkt` file). Make a comment indicating who
you worked with. The other person (or people) in the group may submit
the same file and also indicate who was in the group or just make a
comment listing all your group members (note: if you don\'t submit a
note listing your group members, your work may not be counted, even if
your group partners list you as the group member).
