`square`.

#### How to submit

Make sure that your file is named correctly:\
Name your file with the combination of your last names, no spaces,
followed by \"PS\" (for \"Problem set\" and the problem set number. For
instance, if your last names are Smith and Lee, the file name should be
`SmithLeePS1.rkt` If there are others in the class with the same name as
yours, you your initial in addition to your last name:
`MSmithJLeePS1.rkt`

At least one person in the group must submit it via canvas as a file
upload (make sure it\'s that `.rkt` file). Make a comment indicating who
you worked with. The other person (or people) in the group may submit
the same file and also indicate who was in the group or just make a
comment listing all your group members (note: if you don\'t submit a
note listing your group members, your work may not be counted, even if
your group partners list you as the group member).
